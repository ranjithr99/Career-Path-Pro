Introduction
Welcome to TheirStack’s API!
You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Jobs endpoint to get real-time and historical jobs from more than 100 countries or the Companies endpoint to get a list of companies by the technology they use or by the roles they are hiring for.
The API is organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.
A Swagger UI of these docs is also available at /openapi.
Authentication
Authentication is done via the API key which you can find in your account settings. When making a call, you’ll have to specify this API key with the Authorization header. Here’s an example:
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Pagination
Responses that return a list of items are paginated. We offer two different pagination strategies:
Page-based: This method allows you to navigate through paginated data by specifying the page and limit parameters. The page parameter indicates the page number you wish to retrieve, while the limit parameter specifies the maximum number of items to return per page. For POST requests, include these parameters in the request body. For GET requests, use them as query parameters.
Offset-based: This method allows you to navigate through paginated data by specifying the offset and limit parameters. The offset parameter indicates the starting point within the collection of results, while the limit parameter specifies the maximum number of items to return. For POST requests, include these parameters in the request body. For GET requests, use them as query parameters.
Some of these endpoints also support the include_total_results body or query parameter. If you set it to false, the responses will be faster, and the field total_results of the response will be null.

POST
/v1/jobs/search
Search Jobs​#Copy link
This endpoint lets you search for jobs posted on thousands of websites and filter by multiple filters, such as job titles, companies, locations, company attributes, dates and many more.
Common use cases
Searching for jobs can be used by job seekers, but also many sales and marketing teams use it to find potential customers. Here are some searches that could be done. Check out also the payload for some examples of those searches.
Search for jobs filtering by the country of the job
Search for jobs filtering by job title
Search for jobs filtering by technologies mentioned in the job
Search for jobs filtering by job description
Search for jobs filtering by company name
Search for jobs filtering by company domain
Search for jobs within a specific date range
Required filters
You must specify at least one of the following filters, or otherwise your request will fail. This is for performance reasons:
posted_at_max_age_days
posted_at_gte
posted_at_lte
company_name_or
Filtering by company
To retrieve jobs from a specific company or a list of companies, you can apply any of the following filters:
company_domain_or
company_linkedin_url_or
company_name_or
company_name_case_insensitive_or
When using multiple company identifier filters, the endpoint will return jobs from companies that match any of the specified identifiers. Therefore, it is advisable to create a separate request for each company if you intend to use more than one identifier.
Credits
By default, this endpoint consumes 1 API credit for each job returned in the response. If you set the body filter blur_company_data to true, the company names will be blurred (alias'd) and the request won't consume credits at all.
Avoiding getting the same job twice
If you make repeated calls to this endpoint and you don't want to get the same jobs twice, there are two options:
Use the discovered_at_gte filter. Passing a value higher than the last time you made a call will return jobs that were discovered only after that.
Use the job_id_not filter. Passing a list of job IDs that you don't want to get will return jobs that are not in that list.
